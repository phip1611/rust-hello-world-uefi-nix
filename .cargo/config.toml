# We use a yet unstable Cargo-feature here called "build-std".
# This is the reason why we need the nightly version (at least in May 2021).
# The feature is required to cross-compile the core-library for the
# target "x86_64-unknown-uefi".
[unstable]
build-std = ["core", "compiler_builtins", "alloc"]
# https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild
# has "memset" "memcpy" etc support (otherwise libc may be used, which is not available)
build-std-features = ["compiler-builtins-mem"]

# default target; not longer required to pass --target manually
[build]
